No negative comments.

The code is very well commented, every function of interest has a comment explaining what is does.
Classes are reusable and easily extendable, there is pretty much no code implemented more then once.
There are multiple objects with things like energy types making code completion work very well and
preventing spelling errors.
And dark mode, you can never go wrong with dark mode.

Overall a very good implementation of the assignment.
